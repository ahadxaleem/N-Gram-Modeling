also used by microorganisms like bacteria. The process is called quorum sensing. Through quorum sensing, bacteria can sense the density of cells, and regulate gene expression accordingly. This can be seen in both gram positive and gram negative bacteria. This was first observed by Fuqua et al. in marine microorganisms like V. harveyi and V. fischeri.
Mass communication is the process of disseminating and sharing information with broad parts of the public via the use of mass media platforms. Generally speaking, it is seen as having a connection to different types of media in that its technologies are employed for the spread of information, of which journalism and advertising are examples. When compared to other types of communication, such as interpersonal communication and organisational communication, mass communication is distinguished by the fact that it concentrates on a limited number of resources that distribute information to a large number of recipients. It is the primary objective of the study of mass communication to determine whether or if the substance of mass communication persuades or otherwise changes the behaviour, attitude, opinion, or emotion of those who are exposed to it.

Mass communication is the term used to describe the sending of communications to a large number of people at the same time. However, in its broadest definition, mass communication may be defined as the process of widespread dissemination of information inside and beyond geographical boundaries.
