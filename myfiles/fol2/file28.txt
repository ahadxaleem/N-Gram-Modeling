Thus Sunnīs believe that the leader (caliph) of the Muslim community possesses human and worldly, rather than divine, authority. They look to the rule of Muḥammad (610–632 ce) and of the Four Rightly-Guided Caliphs (632–661 ce) as a special normative period in which God's favor was clearly upon the Muslims.
