 turned down and women were integrated into the new university alongside men. The education of nuns presented another problem, as the Catholic authorities were reluctant to allow them to mix freely with male students in the colleges of the National University. Several Catholic women's colleges applied for affiliation with the National University, but their bids were unsuccessful, and nuns began to attend college lectures on a regular basis beginning in the mid-1920s. Although fewer women than men completed secondary school and entered university for much of the first half of the twentieth century, this pattern was largely reversed by the 1980s. Female participation and performance statistics in secondary education are now equal to or better than male rates, and women make up just over half of all undergraduate and postgraduate students in Irish universities. In addition, women's participation in the traditionally male fields of medicine, law, and accountancy have now reached or exceeded 50 percent.
