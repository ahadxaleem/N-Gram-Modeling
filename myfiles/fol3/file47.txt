oyal University senators took up the women's cause and offered the use of university rooms to University College fellows who agreed to repeat their lectures to women. This unsatisfactory arrangement lasted only a few years because many fellows refused to repeat lectures, and others charged fees well beyond the means of women students. Finally in 1901, under enormous pressure, college authorities were forced to admit women to lectures in University College. Only second- and third-year arts students, mainly drawn from Catholic colleges, were allowed into lecture halls. First-year students were excluded and women were still barred from becoming full members of the college community. All these restrictions were lifted in 1908 with the establishment of the National University of Ireland. University College, Dublin, and the Queen's Colleges in Cork and Galway became constituent colleges of the new university, while the Belfast Queen's College became Queen's University. Women were awarded full equality in these institutions in the areas of teaching, degrees, and staff appointments.

Every university in the United Kingdom with the exception of Durham had admitted women (without giving them degrees) by 1892, and even Oxford and Cambridge had allowed women to attend lectures and to be placed on examination lists. Female activists
