Qualitative research
Qualitative research is often designed to answer questions about the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of individuals.

Sometimes the participants are aware they are being observed, and other times the participants do not know they are being observed. Strict ethical guidelines must be followed when covert observation is being carried out.
